      I write code. I share code. I love code. I am curious and fascinated about computers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I am not coding I am making people smile. I make jokes and giggle offering a warm radiant energy that people seem to love. This makes me happy.

        I have an eye for aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly, developer-friendly products and solutions. My skills are not limited to web development. I offer graphical, quality assurance and operational skills by experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work well within teams and offer intrinsic leadership skills and encourage others to voice their opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find great happiness in coding, learning and solving problems. I also like to collect e-books, read, watch anime, listen to punk rock music and try to push myself outside of my comfort zone.
