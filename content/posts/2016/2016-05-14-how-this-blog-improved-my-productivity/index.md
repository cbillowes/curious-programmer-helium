> Having a pet project has some powerful benefits. Do you have one? What
> benefits have you observed?

I started this blog as a [course](http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/).
I decided to meticulously create the site from scratch keeping in mind page
speed and user experience.

It took a lot more time and dedication from me. I had to create features from
scratch instead of using a CMS and existing design template.
As a back-end developer with a love for front-end, this approach was way more
exciting for me. I could dive deep into a feature, understand its benefits and
decide if it was really worth adding it.

## Personal benefits

### I have direction

I like writing code in my spare time. I often find myself writing code that
goes nowhere. I tend to over think and over complicate it. This is usually
because I don't have a clear direction to focus on. By creating something with
direction, I have a goal and it is fulfilling to see the "product" materialize.

### Exposure to iterative development

By having to create all the features from scratch, I need to take an iterative
approach. It's like running my own little Agile project. This is very exciting
as I need to put different types of hats on during development. I have to
switch between a user, product owner, designer and developer.

I release iteratively at my own schedule. This exposes me to the problems
business may face if an important feature is introduced. It's a fun exercise.

### Autonomy feels good

By having full autonomy on my pet project I can do as I please. This is
exciting as you are working on your own product and make your own decisions.
It boosts creativity, allows you to experiment and helps find solutions to
problems that you can apply at work.

## Productivity benefits at work

### Knowledge can be applied

It may not help my role directly but it can have a positive impact on the team.
I can liaise with front-end developers, help with grunt tasks & SASS, improve page
speed and work closer with designers.

### Confidence is boosted

I started telling people about the site at work. This is something that is
outside my comfort zone. I like making things, then keeping it to myself or
chucking it because I am scared of the feedback.

All that went out of the window when I launched **{{ site.title }}**. I just
started telling everyone I could. I linked it to my online profiles.
I share my articles.

This may freak me out but it has boosted my confidence a lot.

### Dabble in different tech

As a corporate developer you tend to get "boxed" into a role within a team. It's not
always easy to be cross-functional even if it comes naturally to you. You need
to build trust and what better way than create your own work of art that you
can share and be proud of.

I started my journey with [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) and
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I was so ecstatic when the designers at work
said the design was beautiful!

I was also able to get my hands dirty with node, ruby, analytics, optimization
and different types of automation in the front-end space.

## My final thoughts

Having a pet project can be beneficial to upskill, boost confidence and think
outside your role. It also provides an opportunity for you to create something
that you can be proud of which can showcase your skills.

By letting your creative juices flow outside of your work environment, you can
positively influence your productivity at work - provided you don't let it
burn you out.
