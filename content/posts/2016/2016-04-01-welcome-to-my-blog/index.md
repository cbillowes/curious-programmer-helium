My name is Clarice Bouwer. I have been a professional software developer 
since 2006 and I still feel like I have absolutely 
[no idea](/blog/the-imposter-within) 
what I am doing.

Regardless, I learn some pretty cool stuff that I want to remember so I jot
it down here and have the opportunity to share it with you.

If you are keen to get to know me, want to share something that you have learned
that can make my life easier (and that of others) or want to thank me for my blog
(which would be nice) then give me a shout out on Twitter at 
[@cbillowes](https://twitter.com/cbillowes), connect with me on 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cbouwer/) or email me at 
[clarice@bouwer.dev](mailto:clarice@bouwer.dev).

Be curious,
Clarice.
