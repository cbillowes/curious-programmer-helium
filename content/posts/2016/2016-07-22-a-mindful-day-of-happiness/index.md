Today I had complete control of my day and my emotions because I was mindful.

I walked mindfully. I spoke mindfully. I thought mindfully. I listened mindfully.
I stood mindfully. I ate mindfully. This is something I have never done before.

Yesterday, I was introduced to
**[five steps to minfulness](http://www.mindful.org/five-steps-to-mindfulness/)**,
a great post written by Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh.

Did you know that you can create a feeling of happiness in your day regardless
of where you are, how you feel, what situation you are in or what time it is?

I was in desperate need of a technique to help me as most days I feel like I
am not in control of my days or emotions, so I decided to give these steps a try.

I actually felt present in my day. I saw, listened and experienced my day like
no other day before. I experienced a great day full of happy moments.

| What I achieved                | Because of               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| I worked sustainably           | I was focused            |
| I was stimulated               | I didn't multitask       |
| I heard what people had to say | I actually listened      |
| I felt productive              | I was completing tasks   |
| I had better posture           | I was mindful of my body |
| I remembered more than usual   | I was consciously doing  |
| I smiled meaningfully          | I was truly content      |

Usually I'd be wrapped up in so many thoughts that I'd end up creating a clutter
around me. I'd forget where I put things down.

This clutter creates anxiety and I can rarely attend to it because I hardly
have enough time. When I do, I am too exhausted to care. This is physical
evidence of the clutter going on in my mind.

I struggle to finish tasks easily because _seemingly more important_ ones
creep up and I'd run around - mentally and physically - multitasking which
results in feeling scatterbrained.

As I was focused today, my mind was present. When I put something down, I put
it down neatly. I didn't forget where I put it because I put it down
consciously. Both was a consequence of doing things with intent.

When I got to work and sat at my table, in a few minutes my table was
effortlessly clean and I had attended to more than I have ever been able to do
in the past. **Everything I did was done with intent and slower than usual.**

-   I learned that it takes time to make time. Rushing to get everything done only
    creates a mental clutter in my mind that impedes clarity and insight.

-   Doing things with intent in a focused manner naturally breaks me out of the
    survival-mode I am so accustomed to and frees me from multitasking.

-   If I can't get to everything in a day, then so be it. Practicing being mindful
    has aided me in approaching my day in a more sustainable way while living in
    the here and now.

-   I felt like a got more out of my day (and time) because I was actually living
    in the moment instead of in the past or future.

This practice is very rewarding, sustainable, keeps me calm and makes me happy.
