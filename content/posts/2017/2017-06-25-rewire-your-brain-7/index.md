In the [part 6](/blog/rewire-your-brain-6/), Neuroplasticity,
we looked at how the chemicals of the brain can change. Changes can be short-term
(chemical), medium term (structural) and long term (functional) and the effects
can be introduced in many ways to make these changes.

I specifically focused on Debbie Hampton's research and knowledge on this topic
as it is exceptionally broad and offers a variety of techniques to rewire
one's brain.

Our actions create reinforcing loops through our behavior. In this post I want
to focus on unhealthy loops and what habits we can implement in order to
improve our quality of life and help break these loops.

## Prioritize sleep

This is probably the most important habit as it impacts our health and well-being.
According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (in Feb 2012),
ongoing sleep deficiency is linked to an increased risk
of heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and stroke.

Let's take a simple example. I have a fear of missing out or what people
these days call FOMO. So I tend to fight sleep. Obviously I wake up feeling
exhausted the next day and don't get to enjoy it to its fullest because I'm tired.

Sleep should be a priority. It affects physical health and daytime performance
and safety. It's suggested that adults get at least 7 to 8 hours sleep a day
with a proper sleep-wake rhythm, so in other words a proper sleep routine
that is consistent. This will make you feel more refreshed and allow you
to enjoy your day better.

_I use a really cool Android app called Sleep as Android to monitor my sleeping
patterns and play a lullaby (thunderstorms) to help me fall asleep._

## Make good life choices

Another example can be the struggle to make good decisions. You're indecisive so
you go back and forth trying to make a decision. The decision you make, you
overthink thus ending up overwhelmed and then following the herd instead of
going on what you think is right.

It's important to be objective and look at the facts - consider all angles but
make a choice.

-   Formulate your own opinions and decisions
-   Don't mistake opinions as facts

## Exercise regularly

Apart from improving quality of life, physical activity has immediate and long-term
health benefits like reducing the risk of developing several diseases.

_Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day.
See everyday activities as a good opportunity to be active.
Try to find the time for some regular, vigorous exercise for extra health and fitness benefits.
Minimize the amount of time spent in prolonged sitting and break up long periods of sitting as often as possible._

## Other habits

Over and above negative reinforcing loops it's important to

-   Drink water
-   Set up a routine
-   Self reflect
-   Journal
-   Be mindful - don't focus on the past problems or future worries
-   Meditate
-   Practice gratitude
-   Read
-   Listen when people are talking
-   Practice self control
-   Try to achieve your goals even when you hit a roadblock
-   Value solitude
-   Learn to say "no"
-   Create a balance in your life
