I was leaving the corporate world behind and needed to rebrand. I had a hard deadline. I had a new job, a new domain and new hosting, I needed a new blog.

I could have rebranded my old blog but I didn't take that approach. In retrospect, it wouldn't have been a bad idea to have done that. Oh well.

I still love the idea of a database-free blog. All my content is kept in markdown files. I started using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) instead of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's a site generator that uses React - so that I could learn React, at the worst possible time. ðŸ˜‚ The learning curve was a mountain.

That lead to some pressure. Features were missing; components didn't work, some were buggy; styling and usability needed tweaking. I put something together.

**I PAUSED!** If there is one thing I learned from corporate programmer is that **it doesn't have to be perfect!** It worked. It looked good. There was content. The core of the "product" was there and ready to be shipped. And so it launched.

As I keep writing, I keep fixing and tweaking small things. Disqus is now working, the dates should be less wonky, animated gifs have a loading, stop and start state. There are actually animated gifs. I am writing more technical articles that before (yup, I was scared to).

There's more I need to do. There will always be more. And that's what makes it exciting!

**What on earth does this have to do with me?**
Probably nothing, unless you want it to mean something. ðŸ˜‰

In my opinion, perfection can result in a stagnated delivery process which could possibly render the product redundant when it ships to market too late.

We keep hearing about iterative this and iterative that so it's not a new concept to launch something and iteratively apply changes with a quick feedback loop from anyone using the product.

It's what I did, it worked and it's still working. The core is there. People can read the stuff I write. The rest of it is just attractive fluff.
