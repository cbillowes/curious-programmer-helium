        <h2>Mode and place of processing the Data</h2>
        <h3>Methods of processing</h3>
        <p>
          The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent
          unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized
          destruction of the Data.<br />
          The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT
          enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes
          strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the
          Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types
          of persons in charge, involved with the operation of this
          Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system
          administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical
          service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies,
          communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data
          Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be
          requested from the Owner at any time.</p>

        <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
        <p>
          The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of
          the following applies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Users have given their consent for one or more specific
            purposes. Note: Under some legislation the Owner may be allowed
            to process Personal Data until the User objects to such
            processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any
            other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not
            apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to
            European data protection law;</li>
          <li>
            provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an
            agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual
            obligations thereof;</li>
          <li>
            processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation
            to which the Owner is subject;</li>
          <li>
            processing is related to a task that is carried out in the
            public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested
            in the Owner;</li>
          <li>
            processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
            interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific
          legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular
          whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or
          contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into
          a contract.</p>

        <h3>Place</h3>
        <p>
          The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any
          other places where the parties involved in the processing are
          located.<br />
          <br />
          Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve
          transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own. To
          find out more about the place of processing of such transferred
          Data, Users can check the section containing details about the
          processing of Personal Data.</p>
        <p>
          Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data
          transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any
          international organization governed by public international law or
          set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the
          security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.<br />
          <br />
          If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by
          checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with
          the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.</p>

        <h3>Retention time</h3>
        <p>
          Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as
          required by the purpose they have been collected for.</p>
        <p>Therefore:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance
            of a contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained
            until such contract has been fully performed.</li>
          <li>
            Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s
            legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to
            fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information
            regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within
            the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the
            Owner.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer
          period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as
          long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may
          be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever
          required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or
          upon order of an authority.<br /><br />
          Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.
          Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to
          rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced
          after expiration of the retention period.</p>
