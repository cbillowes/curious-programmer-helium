I am joining the world of the Clojurists and am preparing myself for this exiting journey by getting my environment set up and learning all these fascinating things outside of my comfort zone.

I need Leiningen. They boast to exist for automating Clojure projects without setting my hair on fire and damn straight skippy, they are right about that. I can get a project created in no time. Running and understanding it right now, well, that is another story.

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein
chmod +x lein
./lein
lein new app-name
```
