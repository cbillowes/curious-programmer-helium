Don't take your knowledge for granted. Share it. Someone will learn something new. It's a great feeling.

Remember it. Keep a record of what you learn. Public blog, memos or even a paperback book, jot it down and help future self.

## Learning

!["codingame logo"](codingame.png)
*"[CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com) is a challenge-based training platform for programmers where you can improve your coding skills with fun exercises (25+ languages supported)"* Clojure is one of them.

### re-frame
[Re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) is a Reagent Framework For Writing SPAs, in ClojureScript. Their documentation is filled with humor. They mention that the frame work is impressively buzzword compliant.

### Reagent tutorials
Create a application which he calls [Giggin](https://learnreagent.com/). The free course has 12 videos taking you through the essentials of creating the basic version of the Giggin app.

## IntelliJ Shortcuts
* `CTRL + D` to duplicate a line

* `CTRL + W` and `CTRL + SHIFT + W` to expand and shrink code selection

* `CTRL + ALT + L` for code alignment

* `CTRL + SHIFT + Backspace` goes back to last edited code

## Tools
* I tried getting [set up in Atom](https://medium.com/@jacekschae/slick-clojure-editor-setup-with-atom-a3c1b528b722) with the help of Jacek Schae. It worked well but I was spoiled with IntelliJ. There were fundamental shortcuts and features that I needed so I didn't continue using it.

* In Atom, to expand and shrink selections using IntelliJ bindings, install `expand-region` package and edit `~/.atom/keymap.cson` to use `ctrl-w` and `ctrl-shift-w` for expand and shrink.

* **[Parinfer](https://shaunlebron.github.io/parinfer/)!** Indent, delete, comment out, preserve indentation. No more worrying about parenthesis.

* IntelliJ. **[Rainbow Brackets](https://github.com/izhangzhihao/intellij-rainbow-brackets)**. Change your life. Do it.
